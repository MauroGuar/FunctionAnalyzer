# FunctionAnalyzer

<p>This is a python program wich receives a function and a point from the console input.

It works using the matplotlib library (wich displays and draw the graphic) and sympy (wich calculates and returns the limits).

Basic Instructions to Use the Program Correctly:

1. Run the program using a python compiler.

2. The message "Enter the function" will show on console.

3. Enter the function in between parenthesis.

3.1. To write some special mathematical operations:

     - Multiplication: "(*)"

     - Division: "(/)"

     - Power: "(b**e)" (b = base; e = exponent)

     - Root: "(r**(0.i))" (r = radicand; i = index (as decimal, ex: 2 = 0.5)) Example: 2âˆš4 = (4**(0.5))
     TIP: Write all these special mathematical operations in between parenthesis.
4. Once you wrote the function on console, press enter.
5. The message "Enter the point" will show on console.
6. Enter the point and press enter.
7. A new window will appear, it will contain the function and with the point.
8. To move and zoom in or out, press the 4 direction keys button. Then, hold left click and moove the mouse to moove around the graphic. 
  To zoom in or out, just hold right click and moove the mouse on the axe you want to zoom in or out direction. 
9. On the console, the function statistics will be visible.
